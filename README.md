### To get started
1. Have moment.js append the current time and date to the header
2. Create divs that will be timeblocks, 9 AM to 5 PM
- Each div will dynamically change color based on time, red for having past, green for upcoming, and white/pale yellow for the current hour (do this by adding styles to specific textarea ids based on the time)
3. Add events that allow you to type into the timeslot divs
- These keyboard entries will be saved in local storage and persist upon refreshing
- Saving will be finalized by a button click to the side of the div
